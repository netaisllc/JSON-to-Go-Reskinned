#JSON-to-Go (reskinned)

(In which we apply a bit of modern UI look and behavior to a great project by another.)
Powered by [AngularJS](http://www.angularjs.org).

###The original project

Circa Jan-2014, Matthew Holt did all the hard work and created a simple to use JSON -to- Go structure
converter. His project is [here](https://github.com/mholt/json-to-go).

###What triggered this project

A swat team from the International Internet Style Police (IISP) raided Matt's site
and slapped it with a "Your Site Hails From the 1990s" iron-ingot medallion.

O the outage, O the bother: such front-end travails...

Happily, such an award carried with it a lifetime certificate to reskin a site, no questions
asked.

We were pleased to redeem the cert, and the results are [here](http://cssian.com/jtg/index.html).

###Choose wisely

Now you can choose: a lean UI from year's past or a snappy, colorful spin on ~2012.

"GO" in peace.
